# Vireo

A library and framework for event-driven application development

> **Caution:** This library is currently under active development. Until version 1.0, the API signatures are subject to change. While the code should be stable (not easily throwing exceptions) even before reaching version 1.0, version pinning is highly recommended.

## Prerequisites

| Software or library | Minimum supported version | Extensively tested version |
| ------------------- | ------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Python (cpython)    | 2.7 or 3.5                | 3.5 for MacOS and Fedora   |
| pika                | 0.10                      | 0.10 for MacOS and Fedora  |
| RabbitMQ            | 3.6                       | 3.6 supplied via Docker    |

## Future supports (if anyone happens to be interested)

* Amazon Kinesis Stream
* Apache Kafka

## Introduction

**Vireo** is a simple library and framework for event-driven applications to stop the classic DRY problem and enable developers to focus on developing applications rather than setting up the base code. There are two modes: a write-only Vireo, called **Core** (`vireo.Core`), and a read-write Vireo, called **Observer** (`vireo.Observer` which is a subclass of `vireo.Core`).

The design is inspired by Node.js event API.

### Features

* Simplify event-driven application development.
* Provide the delayed message handling.

> The delayed message handling is heavily relying onÂ **dead letter exchange (DLX)** when Vireo is used with RabbitMQ.

### Roadmap (Soon to be implemented):

* the factory class to simplify the setup for either an emitter or an observer.

## Getting started

You can simply write.

```python
from vireo                  import Observer # or Core
from vireo.drivers.rabbitmq import Driver
from vireo.observer         import SYNC_START

# Instantiate the observer
driver = Driver('amqp://guest:guest@localhost:5672/%2F')
app    = Observer(driver) # or Core(driver)

# ... Bind event handlers ...

# Waiting all handlers to stop (only for a observer).
app.join(SYNC_START) # ASYNC_START (for non-blocking join)
```

## APIs

### `vireo.Core.emit(event_name, data = None, options = None)`

Emit a message to the given event.

```python
app.emit('security.alert.intrusion', {'ip': '127.0.0.1'})
```
<!--
### `vireo.Observer.open(event_name, options = None, delegation_ttl = None)`

Prepare to observe an event.

If `delegation_ttl` is `None`, the delegation will not be enabled. Otherwise, it will be enabled.

To enable delegation, ``delegation_ttl`` must not be set to ``None`` or ``0`` or ``False``.

The delegation of the event happens when there exists no listener to that event. Then,
the message will be transfered to the delegated event, which is similar to the given
event name but suffixed with ``.delegated``. For instance, given an event name
"outbound_mail_delivery", the delegated event name will be "outbound_mail_delivery.delegated".

To handle the delegated event, simply listen to the delegated event. For example,
continuing from the previous example, you can write ``on('outbound_mail_delivery.delegated', lambda x: foo(x))``.

```python
app.open('foo')
```

### `vireo.Observer.close(event_name, options = None)`

Clean up after observing an event.
-->
### `vireo.Observer.on(event_name, callback)`

Listen to **a direct event** with a callback function.

The callback is a callable object, e.g., function, class method, lambda object, which
takes only one parameter which is a JSON-decoded object.

```python
def on_foo(self, message):
    print('on_foo:', message)

app.on('foo', on_foo)
app.on('foo.lambda', lambda x: print('foo_lambda:', x))
```

### `vireo.Observer.on_broadcast(event_name, callback)`

Listen to **a broadcasted event** with a callback function.

The callback is a callable object, e.g., function, class method, lambda object, which
takes only one parameter which is a JSON-decoded object.

```python
def on_bar(self, message):
    print('on_bar:', message)

app.on_broadcast('bar', on_foo)
app.on_broadcast('bar.lambda', lambda x: print('bar_lambda:', x))
```

### `vireo.Observer.stop()`

Send the signal to all handlers to stop observation.

> NOTE: This method does not block the caller thread while waiting all handlers to stop.

```python
app.stop()
```

### `vireo.Observer.join(running_mode = vireo.observer.SYNC_START)`

Wait for all handlers to stop.

There are two mode: synchronous (``vireo.observer.SYNC_START``) and asynchronous
(``vireo.observer.ASYNC_START``) joins.

```python
app.start(ASYNC_START)
```

## Try it out?

In the spirit of getting people started earlier, there is a sample code implemented as part of the
source code (but it is never enabled by default.) However, the sample code is only working with
Python 3.5 or newer due to one of the development-only requirements.

If you want to see and play with it, you can start by first cloning or downloading this source code.
Here is how you can clone this.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:shiroyuki/vireo.git
```

Then, install [Gallium Framework](https://github.com/shiroyuki/gallium.git) by running this command.

```bash
pip3 install gallium
```

### Run the sample observer

To run, execute `g3 sample.observe -d -b amqp://guest:guest@localhost:5672/%2F` where
RabbitMQ is running from the local host.

This command will automatically create one exchange:
* `fallback/vireo.sample.primary/vireo.sample.primary.delegated`

This command will also automatically create three queues (event queues):
* `vireo.sample.primary` with no listeners, 5-second message TTL and DLX to the created exchange,
* `vireo.sample.primary.delegated` bound to the created exchange with one echo-only listener,
* `vireo.sample.secondary` with one echo-only listener.

### Emit an event

To emit an event, run `g3 event.emit -d -b amqp://guest:guest@localhost:5672/%2F EVENT_NAME JSON_DATA`.

For example,

```bash
g3 event.emit -d -b amqp://guest:guest@localhost:5672/%2F vireo.sample.secondary "{ \"id\": 12345 }"
```
